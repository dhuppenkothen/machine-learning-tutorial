K-Nearest Neighbours is just one out of many different machine learning algorithms (there'll be some resources for further reading at the 
end of the tutorial). Let's take a look at a second, very different algorithms, to get a feeling for how different algorithms work.

For this particular algorithm, we're going to simplify the problem to start: we're going to look at trying to distinguish plain M&Ms from 
peanut M&Ms (and leave out skittles and jellybeans for now), and we're going to look at a single feature: the longest extent of each sweet, 
which I've labelled "length" in my data set. 

To prepare we're also going to make one change in our data set. When I recorded my measurements, I wrote down what each sweet I measured was 
in words, e.g. "plain M&M", and "peanut M&M". This is great, because it's descriptive! However, for this algorithm to work, we're going to 
need to transform our labels into numbers, so we're going to do a substitution. Plain M&Ms will be labelled with "0", peanut M&Ms will be 
labelled with "1" (the reason for these numbers will become clear in a moment). Once we've done that, we can now plot the data for our 
plain and peanut M&Ms on a graph, like so:

<a href="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_data.png"><img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_data.png" alt="Graph of data points for plain and peanut M&Ms, using length on the x-axis, and the label (0 for plain, 1 for peanut) on the y-axis." /></a>
 
We can see that the plain M&Ms cluster to the left (all their points are zero on the y-axis), whereas the peanut M&Ms cluster to the right. This is 
because the peanut M&Ms have, well, peanuts in them, so they're longer. What we want to do is _predict_ whether a given piece of candy is 
a plain or peanut M&M, given that we've measured its length. In order to do that, we want to fit a *function* through our data points. If we can 
find a function that describe our data points well, then for any given length we measured from an unknown piece of candy, we can read the relevant 
label off that function.

While the step function mentioned in the solution to the challenge above does really well at modelling this problem, it has some undesirable characteristics: 
in particular, because it has a discontinuity at the threshold, it is not differentiable, which makes optimization (i.e. using a computer to find the 
best value for that threshold), difficult in practice.

So what is the simplest differentiable model we could use? Well, the simplest model is a straight line, $$z = ax + b$$ so let's fit that through our data:

 <a href="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_straightline.png"><img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_straightline.png" alt="Graph of data points for plain and peanut M&Ms, using length on the x-axis, with a straight line function fit through the data points." /></a> 

That's a simpler model, but not one that fits our data particularly well: the function does not really go through the data points. The reason for that is that 
the straight line model predicts a real value $$z$$ for each input $$x$$ (which is our length feature here). But our outputs aren't continuous real values: 
they're either zeros or ones! There's a trick we can employ to take that straight line model above, and make it output mostly zeros and ones, and produce a 
function that is quite similar to the step function we used above. 

This is called the **logistic function**, which is defined as 

$$ 
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{-z}} 
$$ 

So if we have a single feature (length), as defined above, our predicted outputs become

$$
y = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{ax + b}} 
$$

What does this function look like for $$a=1$$ and $$b=0$$?

<a href="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_logreg.png"><img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_logreg.png" alt="Graph of the standard logistic function." /></a>

By default, the logistic function is 0 for $$x << 0$$, 1 for $$x >> 0$$, and crosses $$0.5$$ exactly at $$x = 0$$. We can find some reasonable 
values for $$a$$ and $$b$$ (in the challenge below, you'll get to do that yourself on a computer), and see whether we can make this model 
fit through the data:

<a href="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_logreg_data.png"><img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/lr_logreg_data.png" alt="Graph of the plain and peanut M&M data, with a  logistic function." /></a>

Overall this does much better than the straight line at fitting through our data points, though it doesn't quite as well as the step function. 
If you look closely, you can see tha tin my data set there's at least one peanut M&M and one plain M&M that have the same recorded length of 1.5cm.
This means that with this single feature, it is impossible to distinguish whether your candy is a plain or peanut M&M if it's exactly 1.5cm long.

If our candies have lengths that are far away from that value, the function above will predict either 0 or 1, or a value close to those numbers, and we 
can confidently predict that it's either a plain or peanut M&M. But waht if the height you've measured is close to 1.5? The function will now predict something 
close to 0.5 and we don't know what to do.

## Multiple Features

What to do if we have multiple features? In the example data set, I've collected features for length, height, width, colour, and others.
So how can we include these in our logistic regression model?

We can do so by adding more parameters and dimensions to our linear model.
For example, for two features $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ (e.g. length and height), we can write down a linear model 

$$
z = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + b
$$

which we can then use as input into the logistic function in the same way we've done above. Here, $$a_1$$ and $$a_2$$ are now two different 
parameters, which need to be estimated simultaneously.

This is a bit harder to represent visually, because we have added a dimension (so our resulting plot would have to be three-dimesional).
Instead of plotting feature versus outcome we are going to plot feature versus feature, where I've used different colours and symbols for 
the different classes. Instead of plotting the predictions as we've done above, I'm also going to set the threshold for decision between 
the classes at 0.5, and plot the $$\sigma(z) = 0.5$$ contour. This is, for this case, the _decision boundary_.
