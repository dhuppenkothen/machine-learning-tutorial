title: "Incorporating Ethics into your Machine Learning Project"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "Is the project I am planning to do an ethical application of machine learning?"
- "Should I do this project in the first place?"
- "If I do this project, who might be harmed by it?"
- "How could the methods/tools/software I'm developing be misused for purposes I consider unethical?"
objectives:
- "learners understand that ethical considerations are integral to all machine learning applications"
- "learners are able to critically question their own motives and approach to solving their problem."
- "Learners can lay out worst-case scenarios in order to design effective counter-measures to mis-use."
keypoints:
- "All machine learning projects should take ethical considerations into account during the planning stages and throughout the completion of the project"
- "Not all machine learning projects are ethical: sometimes, the right choice is to abandon a project."
- "Projects might be used for data sets or applications that the developers never intended it for. It is important to envision potential uses that might turn out to be harmful."

This tutorial owes a lot to previous machine learning tutorials at [Astro Hack Week][ahw],
especially Iain Murray's and Gilles Louppe's [tutorials](ml2018) and Adrian Price-Whelan and David W Hogg's [tutorial](ml2017). It is also a follow-up on Gwen Eadie's [paper](mmpaper) on teaching Bayesian statistics with 
M&Ms. Because what better way to learn statistics and machine learning through chocolate?
