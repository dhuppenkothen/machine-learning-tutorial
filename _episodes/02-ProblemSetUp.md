You and two friends, Sarah and Michael, are planning a joint birthday party together.
"Good news!", you tell your friends. "They had large bags of different types of sweets on special offer, so 
I've bought enough for the party!"
You bought several ten-pound bags of M&Ms, skittles and jellybeans. 
But: "I poured them all all into the big storage box we have in the kitchen", you tell your friends, who 
suddenly look horrified.
"Oh no!", says Sarah, "My friends from the Skittles Meetup are coming! They'll be super annoyed if they find 
M&Ms with their skittles!"
"Yeah", Michael agrees, "and we've got both peanut and plain M&Ms. What if some of our guests have a peanut 
allergy?"
You get a bowl of the sweets from the container and look at them:

</a>

"This is a disaster!", you admit, despairing over the task in front of you.
So what to do now? Sorting forty pounds of small pieces of candy sounds extremely tedious and time-consuming. 
Your friend Sarah--an engineering student--turns thoughtful. "What if we build a robot to sort the sweets?"
That seems like a great idea. "But how is the robot going to know which is which if we don't tell it?"
Michael has an idea: "I've recently learned about machine learning! Maybe we can train a computer to distinguish 
the different types of sweets, and that computer can tell the robot into which bin each belongs."

You have a plan!
