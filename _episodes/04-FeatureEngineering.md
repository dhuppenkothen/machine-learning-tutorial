### How do we approach the problem of sorting candy in practice? 

If you look at the picture from [Episode 2](ep2), you probably notice some difference between the different types of candy. Humans tend to be very good at classification. Many of you can probably take one look at the picture and immediately recognize that some candy are different than others. You can make categories of different candy based on their appearance, and crucially, you probably don't even have to articulate *what* exactly is different about one sweet compared to another: you can just tell. This, of course, extends past the visual domain: I could give you different types of candy to touch, and you could tell the difference by touch, too.

Our ability to classify objects is trained from early childhood, and rests upon many hours of learning and experience. 
A computer, on the other hand, generally operates according to *rules* and *models*. We need to tell it what to do!

In the case of machine learning, we will tell the computer to optimize a *model*, a mathematical equation or set of mathematical equations that describe how to put our candy into different categories. We'll talk more about some exact mathematical equations in a later lesson. For now, it's important to understand that these mathematical equations have *free parameters*, and that we don't know from first principles how exactly to write them down. 

Along with the mathematical description of the algorithm, we will give the 
computer a second ingredient: the _training set_. The training set are data points (in our case, individual pieces of candy) for which we already know whether they're skittles, M&M's, or jellybeans.

### How do we combine our candy, which are real, physical objects, with the mathematical equations of our model?

We need to make explicit what our eyes and brains do automatically: find descriptors of our objects that might separate them 
into different classes. In machine learning, we call these descriptors *features*: they are generally _summaries_ of our information 
in some way.

> * What are descriptive features that help your eyes distinguish the two types of M&Ms, the skittles, and the jellybeans?
> * Could you measure these features and encode each in a single number per feature and sweet? 
> * Are all of the features you write

Once we've defined some features that we think are helpful in telling the computer how to distinguish the different 
types of candy, we're ready to record some _training data_. In a training data set, we include measurements for 
all of our relevant features for each sweet, but we also include the type of sweet we measured, i.e. whether it was a 
skittle or one of our two types of M&Ms or a jellybean. 

In machine learning, each object recorded in a training data set is called a *sample*. Each sample belongs to one of 
several *classes* (hence the name classification; in our case the different types of candy), and the class we record 
for each is called a *label*.   

> ## Challenge: Recording training data
> 
> Let's now record some data in practice! If you don't have the candy or tools to record data, you can also 
> use [this pre-recorded data set](candy_data) (when you get to that page, right-click on the file `candy_data_200611.tsv`, 
> and choose "download linked file" or the equivalent).
>
> Pick four features you think will do well at describing your candy, and record the value for ten candy of 
> each class. 
>
> Hint: you can use any spreadsheet programme to record your data, or you can use [this template](candy_template). 
> The template is a `.tsv` file: this is a text file where each row corresponds to a sample, and each column 
> to a feature. Columns are separated by tabs, hence the name (`tsv` stands for "tab-separated values").
