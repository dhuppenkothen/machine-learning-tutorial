### Basic Setup

If you're following along using real candy, you'll need:
* at least two out of the following: peanut M&Ms, plain M&Ms, skittles, jellybeans (note: you can also use other types of candies that are small and approximately round); for each, a small snack-sized bag is enough!
* a few sheets of letter (or A4) sized paper
* a pen

### Computational Setup

Some of the advanced exercises involve writing software code. For this, you'll need a working computer, with the programming language and its 
interpreter/compiler set up. The example code uses _Python_ and the associated scientific computing stack (numpy, scipy, Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn), which 
you can download, for example, as part of the [Anaconda distribution](anaconda). If you have your own candy, you can record your own training data as an electronic
table. If you don't have your own, you can download the [pre-recorded data](sweet_data): on that website, right-click on the button called "raw" and use 
the "Save Data as" option to save the file to your computer.
